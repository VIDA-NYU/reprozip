1.0.16 (2019-02-06)
-------------------

(reprozip-jupyter and reprounzip-vagrant didn't change)

Bugfixes:

Bugfixes:
* Fix uninitialized return value making some xxx_at() calls abort the trace
* Fix some other warnings via static analysis

Enhancements:

* Don't use the experiment's resolv.conf file
* Fix handling of files opened in read-write mode

1.0.8 (2016-10-07)
------------------

Behavior changes:
* No longer default to overwriting trace directories. ReproZip will ask what to do or exit with an error if one of --continue/--overwrite is not provided

Bugfixes:
* Fix an issue identifying Debian packages when a file's in two packages
* Fix Python error `Mixing iteration and read methods would lose data`
* Fix reprounzip info showing some numbers as 0 instead of hiding them in non-verbose mode
* Another fix to X server IP determination for Docker

Enhancements:

* Add filters to remove some common files types from packed files (.pyc) or detected input files (.py, .so, ...)
* Add JSON output format to `reprounzip info`
* Allow using the Virtualbox display to reproduce X11-enabled experiments

1.0.7 (2016-08-22)
------------------

Bugfixes:

Enhancements:
* Add support for RPM-based distributions, in addition to Debian-based

1.0.6 (2016-06-25)
------------------

(reprounzip-vistrails didn't change)

Bugfixes:
* Fixes error using Docker with `--enable-x11` on Python 3

Enhancements:
* `docker run` gets a `--detach` command, to keep the container running (useful for starting servers on remote machines)
* Restrictions on upload and download commands have been relaxed, in particular it is possible to download input files as well as output files
* Don't compress outer tar (data is still compressed); this should make some operations (like `reprounzip info`) faster
* Add `reprozip combine`, useful to combine multiple traces into one (as different runs). Handy if running distributed experiments on shared filesystem (MPI)

1.0.5 (2016-04-07)
------------------

(reprounzip-vagrant didn't change)

Bugfixes:
* Correctly download parameters from server
* More reliable way of determining X server IP without using /bin/ip

1.0.4 (2016-03-10)
------------------

Behavior changes:
* reprounzip will no longer run on Python 2.6

Bugfixes:
* Fixes file download not using cache if URL is HTTPS
* Fixes unpacking with directory or chroot for some multi-step packages

Features:
* Add `--docker-option` to pass raw options to Docker
* You can use `run` or `run -` to run every run, regardless of their number
* Allow `download <name>`, shortcut for `download <name>:./<name>` (downloads to current directory, keep name)
* Allow `download --all`
* Add `--input` and `--output` to showfiles
* Implement `vagrant suspend` command
* Do file downloads with [requests](http://python-requests.org/)
* Download a parameter file to update URLs and image names without waiting for the next ReproZip version

1.0.3 (2015-12-02)
------------------

Bugfixes:
* You could get a traceback with some unpackers (not Vagrant) on some packages that explicitely pack the / directory
* Some environment variables prevented running, such as bash exported functions.

Features:
* Remove setup directory if setup fails, so you can run setup again without gettin `target directory exists`
* Add `--set-env` and `--pass-env` to run

1.0.2 (2015-10-26)
------------------

Bugfixes:
* You can now use X11 forwarding even with a remote Docker daemon
* reprounzip-vagrant now works in paths containing spaces

1.0.1 (2015-10-12)
------------------

Bugfixes:
* Files opened through a shebang were stored with a wrong process number
* Running with Docker on non-Linux machine didn't work (e.g. docker-machine); now only X11 doesn't work.
* Some fixes to the graph command

Features:
* `--memory` option for `reprounzip vagrant setup`, to set the VM's RAM.

1.0.0 (2015-09-30)
------------------

Behavior change:
* .rpz pack format changed (version 1 -> 2). Pack is now uncompressed, data is in a nested TGZ archive; allows faster retrieval of metadata (config & trace).
* reprozip trace warnings are now info messages; won't show up without -v

Bugfixes:
* After restarting a Vagrant machine, /dev and /proc wouldn't be mounted anymore
* Files or links referenced in a shebang could be missed by the tracer

Features:
* Runs in the configuration file now have an 'id' field, that will be shown by 'reprounzip info' and can be selected when running
* Reworked `reprounzip graph`: level of details, regex filters & replace, JSON output
* Added *run* argument to `reprounzip showfiles`, to show inputs & outputs of a single run

0.7.2 (2015-08-24)
------------------

Behavior change:
* reprounzip-docker will now re-use the resulting image from the previous run when running again, instead of starting from scratch; a 'reset' command has been added to undo runs and uploads.

Bugfixes:
* Couldn't reset an input file to the original (packed) file on Python 3
* Don't show a warning about network connections when they didn't succeed
* Hide traceback when failing because Vagrant is not installed
* Fix input/output file detection assigning files to the same run
* Fix selecting multiple runs in 'docker run'

Features:
* Display the relative portion of the path when unhandled xxx_at() syscalls are used, to give an idea of what's been missed
* Add --dont-find-inputs-outputs to reprozip trace and reset, so you can clear that out if too many files would be selected (or if you don't use the feature)
* Rewrote reprounzip-vistrails plugin; uses a proper VisTrails package that now lives in the VisTrails distribution.
* Check pack format in unpackers; won't try to unpack version 2
* It is now possible to select multiple runs with `unpackername run 1-4`

0.7.1 (2015-07-14)
------------------

(reprozip only)

Bugfixes:
* Files (or links) created with rename, link or symlink then read will no longer be packed.
* A buffer overflow could happen in the log module, for instance when the experiment passes a very long argument to execve (over 4kB in a single argument) and running in debug mode (-v -v)


0.7 (2015-07-07)
----------------

Behavior change:
* No longer accept passing `-v` after the subcommand; use `reprozip -v testrun ...`, not `reprozip testrun -v`.
* Rely on `PTHREAD_EVENT_EXEC` to handle `execve()`. Makes tracing more reliable, and enable it to behave correctly on weird kernels (like UML).
* Rely on `PTRACE_EVENT_FORK` to handle `fork`/`vfork`/`clone`. Fixes vfork() deadlocking under trace.
* Completely changed the structure of input and output files (old packs will still be loaded, but new packs are not retro-compatible).
* Using one of the `run` commands without specifying a number will no longer default to running all of them; it will error out if there are multiple runs.

Bugfixes:
* Fix insertion speed in SQLite3 database

Features:
* Makes VMs (Vagrant or Docker)  more resilient to massive breakage of system libraries (obliterating /lib or /usr, when using very different operating systems) by putting busybox in / and using [rpzsudo](https://github.com/remram44/static-sudo).
* No longer use `dpkg -S` to identify packages, do a single pass over internal dpkg database (this is considerably faster).

0.6.4 (2015-06-07)
------------------

(reprounzip-vistrails didn't change)

Bugfixes:
* Tracer: correctly handle `chdir()` in multi-threaded processes
* Fix leaked file descriptors, eventually making SQLite3 fail
* No longer exceed cmdline length in Dockerfile in big .RPZ pack
* Fixes `check_output` call when running Docker (not available in Python 2.6)
* Fixes installation of `sudo` failing if original machine wasn't Debian
* Don't make TAR error status fatal in Dockerfile (might not run; this is needed because Docker mount some files in the container that can't be overwritten)

0.6.3 (2015-05-06)
------------------

(reprounzip and plugins only)

Bugfixes:
* Fixes reprounzip-vistrails failing because of reporting

0.5.1 (2014-12-18)

* reprounzip-vagrant will use 'ssh' executable if it's available; should be more reliable, especially on Windows
* Automatically collects usage information. Nothing will be sent before you opt-in, and we made sure to only collect general details

----------------

Features:
* All reprounzip plugins can be installed with `pip install reprounzip[all]`
