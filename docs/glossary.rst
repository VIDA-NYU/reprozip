    configuration (file)
        A YAML file generated by ``reprozip trace`` and read by ``reprozip pack``. It can be edited before creating the package to control which files are to be included. It also contain other metadata used during reproduction. See :ref:`packing-config`.

    distribution package
        A software component installed by the Linux distribution's package manager. ReproZip tries to identify from which distribution package each file comes; this allows the reproducer to install the software from his distribution's package manager instead of extracting the files from the ``.rpz`` file.

    bundle (or pack)
        A ``.rpz`` file generated by ``reprozip pack``, containing all the files and metadata required to reproduce the experiment on another machine. See :ref:`packing`.

    run
        A single command line traced by ``reprozip trace [--continue]``. Multiple commands can be traced successively before creating the bundle; the reproducer will be able to run them separately using ``reprounzip <unpacker> run <directory> <run-id>``.

    software package
        The same as a distribution package.

    unpacker
        A plugin for the `reprounzip` component that reproduces an experiment from a ``.rpz`` bundle. The unpackers `chroot`, `directory`, and `installpkgs` are distributed with `reprounzip`; others come in separate packages (`reprounzip-docker` and `reprounzip-vagrant`). See :ref:`unpack-unpackers`.
