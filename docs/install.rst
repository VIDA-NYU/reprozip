Installation
************

ReproZip is available as open source, released under the Revised BSD License. The tool is comprised of two components: **reprozip** (for the packing step) and **reprounzip** (for the unpack step). Additional components and plugins are also provided for *reprounzip*: **reprounzip-vagrant**, which unpacks the experiment in a Vagrant virtual machine; **reprounzip-docker**, which unpacks the experiment in a Docker container; and **reprounzip-vistrails**, which creates a VisTrails workflow to reproduce the experiment. More plugins may be developed in the future (and, of course, you are free to :ref:`roll your own <develop-plugins>`).
In our `website <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__, you can find links to our PyPI packages and our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/reprozip>`__.

In the following, you will find installation instructions for :ref:`linux`, :ref:`mac`, and :ref:`windows`. ReproZip is also available for the :ref:`conda` Python distribution.

Linux
=====

For Linux distributions, both *reprozip* and *reprounzip* components are available.

Required Software Packages
--------------------------

Python 2.7.3 or greater, or 3.3 or greater is required to run ReproZip [#bug]_. If you don't have Python on your machine, you can get it from `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`__. You will also need the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`__ installer.

Besides Python and pip, each component or plugin to be used may have additional dependencies that you need to install (if you do not have them already installed in your environment), as described below:
