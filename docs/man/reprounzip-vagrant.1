.TP
.BI setup " [\-\-dont\-use\-chroot] [\-\-dont\-bind\-magic\-dirs] [\-\-base\-image IMAGE] [\-\-distribution DISTRIBUTION] [\-\-memory MEMORY] [\-\-use\-gui] [\-\-expose\-port PORT] <package.rpz> <directory>"
Unpacks an experiment and sets it up for reproduction in the specified directory. A virtual machine will be created from the specified base
.I IMAGE
by adding the experiment's content on top of it. The default is to extract the experiment's files in a chroot inside the machine, and binding "magic dirs" into it
.RI ( /proc ", " /dev ", ...);"
this can be disabled using \-\-dont\-use\-chroot.
.TP
.BI run " [\-\-no\-stdin] [\-\-no\-pty] [\-\-expose\-port PORT] [\-\-enable\-x11] [\-\-x11\-display DISPLAY] [\-\-pass\-env VAR] [\-\-set\-env VAR[=val]] <directory> [run] [\-\-cmdline ...]"
Runs an experiment that has been unpacked to a directory.
.TP
.BI upload " <directory> [localfile:experimentfile] [...]"
Replaces a file inside the virtual machine with your own. This allows you to reproduce an experiment in its original environment, but with modified data or configuration. Running this command with only the
.I directory
will list all the named files that you can replace with this command.
.TP
.BI download " <directory> [experimentfile[:localfile]] [...]"
Download a file from the virtual machine to your filesystem. If
.I localfile
is not specified, a file of the same name will be written in the current directory. Running this command with only the
.I directory
will list all the named files that you can download with this command.
.TP
.BI destroy " <directory>"
Removes an unpacked experiment directory, and the associated virtual machine.
