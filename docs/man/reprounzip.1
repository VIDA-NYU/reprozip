.SS Unpacker commands:
Each unpacker (such as

has a similar set of commands, detailed below. Please refer to
.BR reprounzip\-\f(BIunpacker (1)
for detailed information about a specific unpacker.
.TP
.BI setup " <package.rpz> <directory>"
Unpacks an experiment and sets it up for reproduction in the specified directory.
.TP
.BI run " <directory> [run] [\-\-cmdline ...]"
Runs an experiment that has been unpacked to a directory.
.TP
.BI upload " <directory> [localfile:experimentfile] [...]"
Replaces a file inside the experiment with your own. This allows you to reproduce an experiment in its original environment, but with modified data or configuration. Running this command with only the
.I directory
will list all the named files that you can replace with this command.
.TP
.BI download " <directory> [experimentfile[:localfile]] [...]"
Download a file from the experiment container/virtual machine/directory to your filesystem. If
.I localfile
is not specified, a file of the same name will be written in the current directory. Running this command with only the
.I directory
will list all the named files that you can download with this command.
.TP
.BI destroy " <directory>"
Removes an unpacked experiment directory, and associated resources such as containers, virtual machines, or mount points.
.B Always use this command
to delete an unpacked experiment, otherwise resources might get left behind, or with chroot you might end up
.B deleting system files
through the mount point that has been created.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.reprozip/log
Log file where reprozip and reprounzip write messages during execution. Useful to report issues to the developers, even if you were running without
.IR \-\-verbose .
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B REPROZIP_USAGE_STATS
If this variable is set to
.I \*(lqoff\*(rq
then usage statistics will be completely disabled (won't be reported, recorded, and won't ask you about it).
.TP
.B REPROZIP_PARAMETERS
If this variable is set to a URL, it specifies an alternate location from which to download runtime parameters. If it is set to
.IR \*(lqoff\*(rq ,
nothing will be downloaded and the bundled parameters will be used instead.
