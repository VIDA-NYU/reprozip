ReproZip project
================

`ReproZip <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a bundle that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

reprounzip-qt
-------------

This is a graphical user interface for the reprounzip package, allowing to unpack and run packed applications without having to use the command-line interface.

Please refer to `reprozip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprozip>`__ and `reprounzip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip>`_ for more information.
