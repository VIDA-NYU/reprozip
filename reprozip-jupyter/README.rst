ReproZip project
================

`ReproZip <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a bundle that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

reprozip-jupyter
----------------

This package provides tracing and reproduction of Jupyter notebooks, allowing one to pack all the libraries and data used in their notebook to allow anyone to re-run it easily.

You can use it from the command-line::

    # Trace & pack
    $ reprozip-jupyter trace mynotebook.ipynb
    $ reprozip pack notebook_environment.rpz

    # Unpack and reproduce
    $ reprounzip docker setup notebook_environment.rpz /tmp/notebook
    $ reprozip-jupyter run /tmp/notebook

Or you can pack directly from the Jupyter notebook interface, if you enable the extension::

    $ jupyter nbextension install --py reprozip_jupyter --user
    $ jupyter nbextension enable --py reprozip_jupyter --user
    $ jupyter serverextension enable --py reprozip_jupyter --user
