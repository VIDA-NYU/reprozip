# Files to pack
# All the files below were used by the program; they will be included in the
# generated package

# These files come from packages; we can thus choose not to include them, as it
# will simply be possible to install that package on the destination system
# They are included anyway by default

# Example:
additional_patterns:

#  - /var/log/apache2/*.log  # Log files directly under apache2/
#  - /var/lib/lxc/*/rootfs/home/**/*.py  # All Python files of all users in
#    # that container
