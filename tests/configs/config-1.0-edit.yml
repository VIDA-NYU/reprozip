# Input and output files

# Inputs are files that are only read by a run; reprounzip can replace these
# files on demand to run the experiment with custom data.
# Outputs are files that are generated by a run; reprounzip can extract these
# files from the experiment on demand, for the user to examine.
# The name field is the identifier the user will use to access these files.

# Files to pack
# All the files below were used by the program; they will be included in the
# generated package

# These files come from packages; we can thus choose not to include them, as it
# will simply be possible to install that package on the destination system
# They are included anyway by default
